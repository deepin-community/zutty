These are the official Zutty icons, intended for people wishing to
integrate Zutty into their graphical desktops, and for people
wishing to package Zutty for such a desktop.

The master icon is zutty.svg, created with Inkscape.

Common rasterized images zutty_<size>.png are included. They were
created by manually exporting the master from within Inkscape, with
the target dimensions set. Feel free to create rasterized images in
other dimensions, if needed.

A simple (example) desktop file is also included.

Normally, you would probably want to:

- install zutty.desktop as:
  /usr/share/applications/zutty.desktop

- install zutty.svg as:
  /usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/zutty.svg

- install the png versions as:
  /usr/share/icons/hicolor/<res>/apps/zutty.png

We do not endorse, nor support any particular desktop environment.
The above resources and advice are provided strictly AS IS, just as
the rest of Zutty.
